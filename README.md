# Godfiles
## Feel like the Lord almighty when you $ bash

Godfiles are a collection of bash profile scripts that include a number of aliases and functions to make using your shell that more biblical. It allows such sin-thwarting syntax as:

```bash
$ thou must smite ~/test_file
$ thou shall flee to ~/Sites/godfiles
$ thou will describe ~/some_folder
```

## Installation

Install just for this shell session by including the file:

    $ source .godfiles

Or install permanently:

    $ cp .godfiles ~/ && echo 'source .godfiles' >> ~/.profile
  
## Full reference

This is coming. Look at the script for now.

## A note on `sudo`

I can't figure out a way of sharing the aliases and functions into the subshell of sudo. So I've removed all the `sudo` based aliases for now. If someone can show me how to do this it'd be much appreciated.

## Contributions

Please contribute as much as you can! It'd be great to have a really comprehensive group of functions. Pull request away, friends. Bonus points for a patch/topic branch, because it makes life that much easier.

Thanks to everyone who's contributed so far:
