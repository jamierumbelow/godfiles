# GODFILES
# by Jamie Rumbelow (http://jamieonsoftware.com).
# 
# FEEL LIKE THE LORD ALMIGHTY WHEN YOU BASH.
# 
# And that's not a euphemism.
# 
# Usage:
# 
#   $ cp .godfiles ~/ && echo 'source .godfiles' >> ~/.profile
#   $ source ~/.godfiles
#   $ thou must smite

# Pronouns. These don't do anything, they're just there to
# add to the overall 'mise-en-scene'
alias thou=''
alias thee=''
alias moses=''
alias you=''

# Some forceful verbs. Because you're god, so someone better fucking listen to you.
alias must='sudo '
alias shall='sudo '
alias will='sudo '

# Some good verbs for various actions.
alias smite='rm -fr' # thou must smite /
function flee { if [[ $1 == 'to' ]]; then shift && cd $*; fi } # thou must flee to ~/Sites
